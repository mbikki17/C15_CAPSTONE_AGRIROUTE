# Software Implementation in Proteus 8

## Here's a quick recap for the software simulation implemented in phase-1

The project implemented a GPS and GSM-based vehicle tracking system in Proteus 8, simulating the acquisition of GPS coordinates and their transmission via SMS using a GSM module. The system used an Arduino Uno to interface between the GPS (NEO-6M) and GSM (SIM900) modules. The GPS module provided real-time latitude and longitude data, while the GSM module sent this data as an SMS to a virtual terminal. The simulation allowed for testing of both GPS data acquisition and SMS transmission, ensuring reliable communication between the components before hardware implementation. The project demonstrated an efficient vehicle tracking solution in a virtual environment.
