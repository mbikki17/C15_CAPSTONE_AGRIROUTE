# Software Implementation in Proteus 8

## Here's a Quick Recap for the Software Simulation Implemented in Phase-1

The project implemented a **GPS and GSM-based vehicle tracking system** in **Proteus 8**, simulating the acquisition of GPS coordinates and their transmission via SMS using a **GSM module**. The system utilized an **Arduino Uno** to interface between the **GPS (NEO-6M)** and **GSM (SIM900)** modules. The **GPS module** provided real-time latitude and longitude data, while the **GSM module** sent this data as an SMS to a virtual terminal. 

The simulation allowed testing of both **GPS data acquisition** and **SMS transmission**, ensuring reliable communication between the components before hardware implementation. This project successfully demonstrated an efficient vehicle tracking solution in a virtual environment.
