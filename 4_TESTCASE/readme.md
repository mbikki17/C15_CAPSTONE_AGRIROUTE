# Test Case Summary for GPS and GSM Vehicle Tracking System from phase-1

The test cases for the GPS and GSM Vehicle Tracking System in Proteus 8 focus on validating core functionalities like GPS data acquisition and SMS transmission. The tests ensure that the system:

- Correctly acquires valid GPS coordinates.
- Displays accurate latitude and longitude.
- Sends the GPS data as SMS messages in the correct format.

Additionally, the system is checked for handling GPS signal loss by displaying default values (`0.0, 0.0`) for latitude and longitude. The GSM moduleâ€™s ability to send the correct SMS after successful GPS data retrieval is also tested, ensuring accurate communication and system behavior.
