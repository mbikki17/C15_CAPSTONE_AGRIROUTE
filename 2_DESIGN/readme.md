# High-Level Design (HLD)

## 1. Architectural Overview

### System Architecture
The system adopts a three-tier architecture consisting of:

- **Frontend (Mobile Application):**  
  User interface for real-time vehicle monitoring and notifications.

- **Backend (Server Infrastructure):**  
  Manages communication, data storage, and analytics.

- **Hardware (Vehicle Tracking Unit):**  
  Captures and transmits real-time data.

### Key Components

#### Vehicle Tracking Unit
- **GPS Module (NEO-6m):** Tracks vehicle location with latitude and longitude updates.
- **GSM Module (SIM900A):** Sends real-time location data via SMS.
- **Microcontroller (Arduino Uno):** Coordinates data flow between GPS and GSM modules.

#### Mobile Application
- **Technologies:** Flutter/React Native for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Features:**
  - Map view for tracking.
  - Notification center for alerts.
  - Feedback submission interface.

#### Server Infrastructure
- **Web Server:** Processes incoming data and handles user requests.
- **Database:** Stores user information, tracking history, and vehicle data.
- **APIs:** Provides RESTful endpoints for communication between the mobile app and backend.

## 2. Main Features
- **Real-time Vehicle Tracking:** Updates on vehicle movements at defined intervals.
- **User Notifications:** Alerts for location updates, delays, and environmental changes.
- **Mapping Services:** Google Maps integration for route visualization.
- **Feedback System:** User feedback to enhance service quality.

# Low-Level Design (LLD)

## 1. Detailed Module Design

### Vehicle Tracking Unit
- **GPS Module (NEO-6m):**
  - Captures geographic coordinates every 5 seconds.
- **GSM Module (SIM900A):**
  - Sends SMS containing vehicle location to the server.
- **Microcontroller (Arduino Uno):**
  - Manages GPS and GSM integration with code written in Arduino IDE.

### Power Supply
- Reliable 12V DC supply with rechargeable battery backup.

### Mobile Application
- **Technologies:** Flutter/React Native for cross-platform functionality.
- **Components:**
  - **Home Page:** Displays real-time vehicle locations on a map.
  - **Tracking Page:** Provides historical tracking data.
  - **Feedback Page:** Collects user ratings and comments.
  - **Authentication:** Secure login via email/password or OAuth.

### Server Infrastructure
- **Technologies:** Node.js/Django for backend logic.
- **Data Handling:**
  - Parses and stores SMS location updates.
  - Database schema using MongoDB for flexible data management.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/track`: Stores location updates.
  - `GET /api/vehicles/:id`: Retrieves vehicle data and tracking history.
  - `POST /api/feedback`: Collects user feedback.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Renders maps and optimizes delivery routes.

## 2. Database Design

### Tables
- **Users Table:**
  - **Columns:** UserID, Name, Email, PasswordHash, PhoneNumber, Role.

- **Vehicles Table:**
  - **Columns:** VehicleID, UserID, VehicleType, CurrentStatus, LastUpdated.

- **Tracking Data Table:**
  - **Columns:** TrackingID, VehicleID, Latitude, Longitude, Timestamp.

- **Feedback Table:**
  - **Columns:** FeedbackID, UserID, VehicleID, Rating, Comments, Timestamp.

### Relationships
- **One-to-Many:** Between Users and Vehicles.
- **One-to-Many:** Between Vehicles and Tracking Data.
- **One-to-Many:** Between Users and Feedback.

## 3. Scalability & Performance
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes requests among multiple backend servers.
- **Data Caching:** Uses Redis for frequently accessed data.
- **Rate Limiting:** Controls API traffic to prevent abuse.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana for system health and performance.
- **Logging:** Winston for capturing logs for debugging and audits.
