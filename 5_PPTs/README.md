Vehicle Tracking System using GPS
and GSM Technology

Author’s Name :
Niraj Sakla
Avinash Pawar
Prof. Anamika Dhawan
Date: 2022
Publication Name: IJRASET

A microcontroller is used
to connect the GPS and
GSM modules. The GPS
module captures the
vehicle’s location through
latitude and longitude
coordinates.
This location data is then
sent to the user’s mobile
phone via the GSM
module as an SMS. Serial
communication is used to
transfer data between the
GPS and the system.
The system provides
real-time tracking,
allowing continuous
monitoring of vehicles.
It is cost-effective.
Users receive instant
SMS alerts with the
vehicle's location,
making it easy to track.
The system does not include
any features for optimizing
energy use.
It focuses solely on tracking
the vehicle's location without
offering additional
functionalities.

Publication Name : IJFMR

Combines GPS,
microcontrollers, and
cloud storage to track
vehicles and manage data
efficiently.
Enables real-time tracking
while ensuring data
privacy and security
compliance.
Incorporating machine
learning for predictive
maintenance and
optimized routing
highlights an innovative
approach to fleet
management, setting
the system apart from
traditional tracking
solutions.
The study’s focus on
data privacy, security,
and regulatory

demonstrates an
understanding of the
ethical implications of
IoT-based tracking
systems.
Although the framework is
described as scalable, there
is no in-depth analysis of
how the system performs
under increasing fleet sizes
or varying network
conditions.
IoT devices often face
challenges related to power
consumption, but this aspect
is not addressed, which is
critical for long-term
deployments.
