## Extended Project Abstract

The **Vehicle Tracking System (VTS)** is a cost-effective and scalable solution designed to improve the agricultural supply chain, especially for perishable goods. Inefficient logistics often cause delays, spoilage, and reduced product quality, leading to financial losses and customer dissatisfaction. Our project addresses these challenges by providing an affordable and easy-to-use system that uses GPS and GSM technologies for real-time tracking and communication between farmers, transporters, and consumers.

The central controller was built around the **Arduino Uno R3**. The **GPS module** tracks vehicle locations accurately in real-time coordinates, with a precision of 2.5 meters. Location updates are relayed to the users via the **GSM module**, helping monitor the movement of the vehicles and providing increased transparency. The system also comes with a **DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor** to monitor the environmental conditions along the transit line. Deviations beyond safe limits automatically trigger alerts to ensure product safety. Furthermore, the **HX711 load cell** ensures proper management of loads by measuring the weight of the goods, preventing overloading. Real-time data such as weight, temperature, and humidity are displayed on the **16x2 LCD screen** for easy accessibility by operators.

The system is designed with scalability in mind, allowing integration of additional sensors or cloud-based platforms for advanced data analysis and real-time monitoring. Its modular design allows minimal effort for future upgrades. The system uses a **12V DC power supply**, ensuring uninterrupted operation, even during power outages, with available backup options.

This new, low-cost solution improves supply chain efficiency by reducing delays and spoilage, while also providing farmers and consumers with better trust and coordination. By emphasizing affordability and scalability, VTS ensures widespread adoption, generating long-term benefits for all participants in agricultural logistics.
