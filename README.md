# 🚜 **Vehicle Tracking System (VTS)**: Revolutionizing Agricultural Logistics 🌱

## 👋 **Welcome to the Future of Agricultural Logistics!**

Hello and welcome! We’re excited to introduce you to the **Vehicle Tracking System (VTS)** — a **cost-effective** and **scalable** solution designed to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain, especially for perishable goods. 🌾

Inefficient logistics often lead to delays, spoilage, and reduced product quality, which can cause financial losses and dissatisfaction for both farmers and consumers. This project aims to solve those problems with a robust, affordable, and easy-to-use system that leverages **GPS** and **GSM** technologies for real-time tracking and communication. 🚚📡

Let’s dive into the key features of VTS!

## ⚙️ **Key Features**:

1. **🌍 Real-Time GPS Tracking**  
   Track vehicles with **2.5-meter precision** and get real-time updates on the movement of agricultural goods. 📍

2. **📲 GSM Communication for Alerts**  
   Receive instant alerts about vehicle movements, including temperature, humidity, and weight, directly to your phone. 📲

3. **🌡️ Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**  
   With the **DHT11 sensor**, keep an eye on environmental conditions along the transit route. 🌞🌧️

4. **⚖️ Load Management with HX711 Load Cell**  
   Ensure proper load management with real-time weight monitoring. Prevent overloading and ensure product safety! 🛻

5. **🔋 Scalability & Future-Proof Design**  
   Easily integrate additional sensors or cloud-based platforms. VTS is ready for future upgrades. 🔧🖥️

## 💡 **How It Works**:

### 🧠 **Arduino Uno R3 Controller**  
At the heart of the VTS is the **Arduino Uno R3**, which coordinates all components and makes everything run smoothly! 🧑‍💻

### 📍 **GPS Real-Time Tracking**  
With **GPS technology**, track vehicle locations in real-time with an accuracy of just **2.5 meters**. Keep all parties updated, from farmers to consumers! 🚜

### 📲 **GSM Alerts**  
The **GSM module** sends notifications for location updates, and environmental changes, and triggers alerts when conditions go outside of safe limits. 📞
